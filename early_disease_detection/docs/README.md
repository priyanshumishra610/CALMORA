# Early Disease Detection ML System

## Project Overview
This project is an ultra-advanced Early Disease Detection ML System, designed with a modular, production-ready MLOps architecture. It leverages ZenML, MLflow, BentoML, Seldon Core, FastAPI, Streamlit, Prometheus, Evidently AI, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Figma, and DVC for robust, scalable, and reproducible machine learning workflows.

## Folder Structure
- `data/` - Raw, processed, and versioned datasets. Integrated with DVC for data versioning.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter or research notebooks for exploration and prototyping.
- `pipelines/` - Modular ML pipelines for ingestion, preprocessing, training, and deployment (ZenML compatible).
- `models/` - Model registry, BentoML bundles, and Seldon deployment configs. MLflow for model versioning.
- `api/` - FastAPI application and route definitions for serving models as APIs.
- `frontend/` - Streamlit app, reusable UI components, and Figma design files.
- `monitoring/` - Prometheus, Grafana, and Evidently AI configs for monitoring and drift detection.
- `ci_cd/` - CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, Helm charts, and Kubernetes manifests.
- `configs/` - Environment variables, Docker Compose, requirements, and global configs.
- `docs/` - System design, API documentation, and compliance information.
